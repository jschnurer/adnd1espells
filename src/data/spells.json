      "When this spell is placed upon a poisoned individual it greatly slows the effects of any venom, even causing a supposedly dead individual to have life restored if it is cast upon the victim within a number of turns less than or equal to the level of experience of the cleric after the poisoning was suffered, i.e. a victim poisoned up to 10 turns previously could be temporarily saved by a 10th or higher level cleric who cast slow poison upon the victim. While this spell does not neutralize the venom, it does prevent it from substantially harming the individual for the duration of its magic, but each turn the poisoned creature will lose 1 hit point from the effect of the venom (although the victim will never go below 1 hit point while the slow poison spell's duration lasts). Thus, in the example above, the victim poisoned 10 turns previously has only 10 hit points, so when the 10th level cleric casts the spell, the victim remains with 1 hit point until the spell duration expires, and hopefully during that period a full cure can be accomplished. The material components of this spell are the cleric's holy/unholy symbol and a bud of garlic which must be crushed and smeared on the victim's bore feet."

      "Similar to an augury spell, a divination spell is used to determine information regarding an area. The area can be a small woods, large building, or section of a dungeon level. In any case, its location must be known. The spell gives information regarding the relative strength of creatures in the area; whether a rich, moderate or poor treasure is there; and the relative chances for incurring the wrath of evil or good supernatural, super powerful beings if the area is invaded and attacked. The base chance for correct divination is 60%, plus 1% for each level of experience of the cleric casting the spell, i.e. 65% 015th level, 66% at 6th, etc. The Dungeon Master will make adjustments to this base chance considering the facts regarding actual area being divined, If the result is not correct, inaccurate information will be obtained. The material components of the divination are a sacrificial creature, incense, and the holy symbol of the cleric. If an unusually patent divination is attempted, sacrifice of particularly valuable gems or jewelry and/or magic items may be required."

Furthermore, it will affect a magical item if such is the object of the exorcism. Thus a soul object of any sort which comes under successful exorcism will make the life force of the creature concerned wholly inhabit its nearest material body, wholly and completely. (Cf. ADVANCED DUNGEONS ft DRAGONS, MONSTER MANUAL, Demon.) The exorcise spell, once begun, cannot be interrupted, or else it is spoiled and useless. The base chance for success is a random 1% to 100%. Each turn of exorcism the dice are rolled, and if the base chance number, or less, is rolled, the spell is successful. Base chance of success is modified by -1% for each level of difference between the cleric's level of experience and the level of the possessor or possessing magic, where the smaller number is the cleric's level. In the obverse, a +1% cumulative is added. The referee can determine base chance according to the existing circumstances if he or she so desires. Material components for this spell are the holy abject of the cleric and holy water (or unholy, in the case of evil clerics, with respect to abject and water). A religious artifact or relic can increase the chance of success by from 1% to 50%, according to the power of the artifact or relic."

The ointment for the reverse spell is concocted of oil, poppy dust, and pink orchid essence. For both spells, the ointment must be aged for 1-6 months."

      "This spell summons an invisible aerial servant (see ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, MONSTER MANUAL) to do the bidding of the cleric who conjured it. The creature does not fight, but it obeys the command of the cleric with respect to finding and returning with whatever object or creature that is described to it. Of course, the abject or creature must be such as to allow the aerial servant to physically bring it to the cleric or his or her assign. The spell caster should keep in mind the consequences of having an aerial servant prevented, for any reason, from completion of the assigned duty. The spell lasts for a maximum of 1 day for each level of experience of the cleric who cast it. The aerial servant returns to its own plane whenever the spell lapses, its duty is fulfilled, it is dispelled, the cleric releases it, or the cleric is slain. The cleric must have a protection from evil spell, or be within a magic circle, thaumaturgic triangle, or pentagram when summoning an aerial servant unless the cleric has his or her religious symbol or a religious artifact or relic to use to control the creature. Otherwise, the creature will slay its summoner and return from whence it came. The aerial servant will always attack by complete surprise when sent on a mission, and gain the benefit of 4 free melee rounds unless the creature involved is able to detect invisible objects, in which case a six-sided die is rolled, and 1 = 1 free round, 2 = 2 free rounds, 3 = 3 free rounds, 4 = 4 free rounds, and 5 or 6 = 0 free rounds (the opponent is not surprised at all). Each round the aerial servant must dice to score a hit, and when a hit is scored, it means the aerial servant has grabbed the item or creature it was sent to take and bring back to the cleric, If a creature is involved, the aerial servant's strength is compared to the strength of the creature to be brought. If the creature in question does not have a strength rating, roll the appropriate number of the correct type of hit dice for the aerial servant and for the creature it has grabbed. The higher total is the stronger."

      "This powerful spell enables the cleric casting it to imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. The animated object, or objects, then attack whomever or whatever the cleric first designates. The object can be of any material whatsoever - wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, etc. The speed of movement of the object is dependent upon its means of propulsion and its weight. A large wooden table would be rather heavy, but its legs would give it speed. A rug could only slither along. A jar would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal would rock forward at 1\" per round, a stone statue would move at 4\" per round, a wooden statue 8\" per round, an ivory stool of light weight would move at 12\". Slithering movement is about 1\" to 2\" per round, rolling 3\" to 6\" per round. The damage caused by the attack of an animated object is dependent upon its form and composition. Light, supple objects can only obscure vision, obstruct movement, bind, trip, smother, etc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or otherwise strike for 1-2 hit points of damage or possibly obstruct and trip as do light, supple objects. Hard, medium weight objects can crush or strike far 2-8 hit points of damage, those larger and heavier doing 3-12, 4-16, or even 5-20 hit points of damage. The frequency of attack of animated objects is dependent upon their method of locomotion, appendages, and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every five melee rounds to as frequently as once per melee round. The armor class of the object animated is basically a function of material and movement ability with regard to hitting. Damage is dependent upon the type of weapon and the object struck. A sharp cutting weapon is effective against fabric, leather, wood and like substances. Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are useful against wood, stone, and metal objects. Your referee will determine all of these factors, as well as how much damage the animated object can sustain before being destroyed. The cleric can animate 1 cubic foot of material for each level of experience he or she has attained. Thus, a 14th level cleric could animate one or more objects whose solid volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet, i.e. a large statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen average cracks."

Only certain magic items which have multi-planed existence can be brought into the Astral Plane. As the Astral Plane touches upon all of the first levels of the Outer Planes, the cleric can travel astrally to any of these Outer Planes as he or she wills. The cleric then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a body on the plane of existence he or she has chosen to enter, It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material Plane by means of the astral spell, but a second body cannot be formed on the Prime Material Plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures on the Astral Plane. At all times the astral body is connected to the material by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially, but generally only the psychic wind can normally cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body, and the cord simply returns to the latter where it rests on the Prime Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astrally projected persons are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions do not affect creatures not existing on the Astral Plane. The spell lasts until the cleric desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means (dispel magic or destruction of the cleric's body on the Prime Material Plane). The cleric can take up to five other creatures with him or her by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the cleric. These fellow travelers ore dependent upon the cleric and can be stranded. Travel in the Astral Plane can be slow or fast according to the cleric's desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the conceptualization of the cleric. (See APPENDIX IV, THE KNOWN PLANES OF EXISTENCE, for further information on the Astral Plane and astral projection.)"

The actions of the being which comes through will depend on many factors, including the alignment of the cleric, the nature of those in company with him or her, and who or what opposes or threatens the cleric. Your Dungeon Master will have a sure method of dealing with the variables of the situation. The being gated in will either return immediately (very unlikely) or remain to take action."

Spell range is ½\" for each level of experience of the magic-user, and its duration is 1 turn per level of experience of the spell caster. The effect of the enlargement spell is so increase the size of a living creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) by 20% per level of experience of the magic-user, with a maximum additional growth of 200%. The effect on objects is one-half that of creatures, i.e. 10% per level too 100% maximum additional enlargement. The creature or object must be seen in order to effect the spell. The maximum volume of living material which can be initially affected is 10 cubic feet - for non-living matter, 5 cubic feet - per level of the magic-user. While magical properties are not increased by this spell - a huge +1 sword is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. - weight, mass and strength are. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective; a hurled stone would have more mass (and be more hurtful providing enlargement took place just prior to impact); chains would be more massive; doors thicker; a thin line turned to a sizable, longer rope; and so on. Likewise, a person 12' tall would be as an ogre, while an 18' tall person would actually be a giant for the duration of the spell. The reverse spell, reduce, will negate the effects or actually make creatures or objects smaller in the same ratios as the regular spell application functions. Unwilling victims of the spell, or its reverse, are entitled too saving throw, which, if successful, indicates the magic does not function, and the spell is wasted.

After casting she spell and determining what can be learned from is, the magic-user loses 8 points of constitution. He or she must rest for 6 turns per 1 point in order so regain them. If she 8 point loss drops she spell caster below a constitution of 3, he or she will fall unconscious, and consciousness will not be regained until full constitution is restored 24 hours later. The material components of this spell area pearl (of at least 100 g.p. value) and an owl feather steeped in wine, with the infusion drunk and a live miniature carp swallowed whole prior so spell casting. If a luckstone is powdered and added so the infusion, probability increases 25% and all saving throws ore made as +4."

      "When the audible glamer spell is cast, she magic-user causes a volume of sound to arise, as whatever distance he or she desires (within range), and seeming to recede, close, or remain in a fixed place as desired. The volume of sound caused, however, is directly related so the level of the spell caster. The relative noise is based upon the lowest level as which the spell can be cast, 3rd level. The noise of the audible glamer as this level is that of 4 men, maximum. Each additional experience level adds a like volume, so at 4th level the magic-user can have she spell cause sound equal so that of 8 men, maximum. Thus, talking, singing, or shouting, and/or walking, marching or running sounds can be caused. The auditory illusion created by an audible glamer spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume must be commensurate with the level of the magic-user casting the spell. A horde of rots running and squeaking is about the same volume as 8 men running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is equal so she noise volume of no fewer than 24 men. If a character states that he or she does not believe the sound, a saving throw is made, and if is succeeds, the character then hears nothing, or possibly just a faint sound. Note that this spell is particularly effective when cast in conjunction with phantasmal force (see below). The material component of the spell is a bit of wool or a small lump of wax."

Your referee will determine any other reductions appropriate to the affected creature, If the target creature makes its saving throw, the spell has no effect."

The rope cannot be taken into she extra-dimensional space if six persons have climbed it, but otherwise is can be pulled up. Otherwise, the rope simply hangs in air, and will stay there unless removed by some creature.

      "Explanation/Description Similar so the second level cleric Hold Person (q.v.), this spell immobilizes creatures, within range, as designated by the magic-user. If three or four persons are attacked, their saving throws are normal; but if two are attacked, their saving throws are mode as -1; and if only one creature is attacked, the saving throw versus the hold person spell is made as -3 on she die. Partial negation of a hold person spell, such as would be possible by a ring of spell turning, causes she spell so function as a slow spell (q.v.) unless the saving throw is successful. Creatures affected by the spell are: brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-arcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, arcs, pixies, sprites, and troglodytes."

      "Upon casting this spell, she magic user releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy which causes damage equal to 1 six sided die (d6) for each level of experience of she spell caster so creatures within its area of effect, or 50% of such damage to such creatures which successfully save versus the attack form. The range of the bolt is the location of she commencement of the stroke, i.e. if shot to 6\", the bolt would extend from this point to n inches further distance. The lightning bolt will set fire to combustibles, sunder wooden doors, splinter up to 1' thickness of stone, and melt metals with a low melting point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). Saving throws must be made for objects which withstand the full force of a stroke (cf. fireball). The area of the lightning bolt's effect is determined by the spell caster, just as its distance is. The stroke can be either a forking bolt 1\" wide and 4\" long, or a single bolt ½\" wide and 8\" long. If a 12th level magic-user cast the spell at its maximum range, 16\" in this case, the stroke would begin at 16\" and flash outward from there, as a forked bolt ending at 20\" or a single one ending at 24\". If she full length of she stroke is not possible due to she interposition of a non~ conducting barrier (such as a stone wall), the lightning bolt will double and rebound towards its caster, its length being the normal total from beginning so end of stroke, damage caused to interposing barriers notwithstanding. Example: An 8\" stroke is begun as a range of 4\", but the possible space in the desired direction is only 3 ½\"; so the bolt begins at the 3½\" maximum, and is rebounds 8\" in the direction of its creator. The material components of the spell are a bit of fur and an amber, crystal or gloss rod."

      "When a fear spell is cast, the magic-user sends forth an invisible ray which causes creatures within its area of effect to turn away from the spell caster and flee in panic. Affected creatures are likely to drop whatever they are holding when struck by the spell; the base chance of this is 60% at 1st level (or at 1 hit die), and each level (or hit die) above this reduces the probability by 5%, i.e. at 10th level there is only a 15% chance, and at 13th level 0% chance. Creatures affected by fear flee at their fastest rate for the number of melee rounds equal to the level of experience of the spell caster. The panic takes effect on the melee round following the spell casting, but dropping of items in hand will take place immediately.

      "The polymorph other spell is a powerful magic which completely alters the form and ability, and possibly the personality and mentality, of the recipient. Of course, creatures with a lower intelligence cannot be polymorphed into something with a higher intelligence, but the reverse is possible. The creature polymorphed must make a \"system shock\" (cf. CONSTITUTION) roll to see if it survives the change. If it is successful, it then acquires all of the form and abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into. There is a base 100% chance that this change will also change its personality and mentality into that af the creature whose form it now possesses. For each 1point of intelligence of the creature polymorphed, subtract 5% from the base chance. Additionally, for every hit die of difference between the original form and the form it is changed into by the spell, the polymorphed creature must adjust the base chance percentage by +/-5% per hit die below or above its own number (or level in the case of characters). The chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form must be checked daily until the change takes place. (Note that all creatures generally prefer their own form and will not willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell!) If a one hit die arc of 8 intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 hit dice, for example, it is 85% (100% - [5% X 8 intelligence] + [(6- 1) X 5%] 85%) likely ta actually become one in all respects, but in any case it will have the dragon's physical and mental capabilities; and if it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it will know what it formerly knew as well. Another example: an 8th level fighter successfully polymorphed into a blue dragon would know combat with weapons and be able to employ them with prehensile dragon forepaws if the fighter did not take on dragon personality and mentality. However, the new form of the polymorphed creature may be stronger than it looks, i.e. a mummy changed to a puppy dog would be very tough, or a brontosaurus changed to an ant would be impossible to squash merely from being stepped on by a small creature or even a man-sized one. The magic-user must use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this too requires a \"system shock\" saving throw. The material component of this spell is a caterpillar cocoon."

The globe will move with the spell caster.

      "There are actually four spells in one as respects conjure elemental. The magic-user is able to conjure an air, earth, fire or water elemental with this spell - assuming he or she has the material component for the particular elemental. A considerable fire source must be in range to conjure that type of elemental; a large amount of water must be likewise available for conjuration of a water elemental. Conjured elementals are very strong - see ADVANCED DUNGEONS S DRAGONS, MONSTER MANUAL - typically having 16 hit dice (16d8). It is possible to conjure up successive elementals of different type if the spell caster has memorized two or more of these spells. The type of elemental so be conjured must be decided upon before memorizing the spell. The elemental conjured up must be controlled by the magic-user, i.e. the spell caster must concentrate on the elemental doing his or her commands, or it will turn on the magic-user and attack. The elemental, however, will not cease a combat to do so, but it will ovoid creatures when seeking its conjurer. If the magic-user is wounded or grappled, his or her concentration is broken. There is always a 5% chance that the elemental will turn on its conjurer regardless of concentration, and this check is made as the end of the second and each succeeding round. The elemental can be controlled up to 3\" distant per level of the spell caster. The elemental remains until its farm on this plane is destroyed due so damage or the spell's duration expires. Note that water elementals are destroyed if they move beyond 6\" of a body of water. The material component of this spell (besides the quantity of the element at hand) is a small amount of:\r\nAir Elemental - burning incense\r\nEarth Elemental - soft clay\r\nFire Elemental - sulphur and phosphorus\r\nWater Elemental - water and sand\r\nN.B. Special protection from uncontrolled elementals is available by means of a pentacle, pentagram, thaumaturgic triangle, magic circle, or protection from evil spell."

      "This spell can only be cast when the magic-user has an earth elemental conjured up, but the elemental will not react hostilely to co-operation with the spell caster when he or she announces that his or her intent is to cast a distance distortion spell. The magic places the earth elemental in the area of effect, and the elemental then causes the area's dimensions to be distorted in either of two ways: 1) the area will effectively be one-half the distance to those traveling over it, or 2) the area will be twice the distance to those traveling across is. Thus a 10' X 100' corridor could seem as if is was but 5' wide and 50' long, or is could appear so be 20' wide and 200' long. When the spell duration has elapsed, the elemental returns to its own plane. The true nature of an area affected by distance distortion is absolutely undetectable to any creatures traveling along is, although the area will radiate a dim dweomer, and a true seeing spell will reveal that an earth elemental is spread within the area. Material needed for this spell is a small lump of soft clay."

If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest may be of gold; and if the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings may be of electrum or silver. The cast of such a chest will never be less than 5,000 g.p. Once constructed, the magic-user must have a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) made, so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. One magic-user can have but one pair of these chests at any given time, and even wish spells will not allow exception!\r\nWhile touching the chest and holding the tiny replica, the caster chants the spell. This will cause the large chest to vanish into the ethereal plane. The chest can contain one cubic foot of material per level of the magic-user no matter what its apparent size. Living matter makes it 75% likely that the spell will fail, so the chest is typically used for securing valuable spell books, magic items, gems, etc. As long as she spell caster has the small duplicate of she magic chest, he or she can recall the large one from the ethereal plane to the locale he or she is in when the chest is desired. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, including a wish, that the large chest will return.\r\nWhile on the ethereal plane, there is a 1% cumulative chance per week that some creature/being will find the chest. If this occurs there is 10% likelihood that the chest will be ignored, 10% possibility that something will be added so the contents, 30% possibility that the contents will be exchanged for something else, 30% chance that something will be stolen from it, and 20% probability that it will be emptied. In addition, when the secret chest is brought back to the Prime Material Plane, an ethereal window is opened and remains open for 5 hours, slowly diminishing in size. As this hole opens between the planes there is a 5% chance that some ethereal monster will be drawn through, with a 1% cumulative reduction in probability each hour thereafter until the window is gone. However, no creature on the Prime Material Plane can locate the chest, even with a gem of seeing, true seeing, etc.\r\nIf Leomund's Secret Chest is not retrieved before spell duration lapses, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest will be lost forever, i.e. 5% chance for loss at 61 days, 10% at 62 days, and so forth."

      "Magic jar is a very unusual spell. Is enables the magic user so take over the mind of the victim and thus control the creature's body. In fact, if the body is human or humanoid, the magic-user can even use the spells he or she knows. The possessor can call upon rudimentary knowledge of the possessed, but not upon the real knowledge, i.e. a possessor will not know the language or spells of the possessed. The spell caster transfers his or her life force to a special container (a large gem or crystal), and from this magic jar the life force can sense and attack any creature within the spell range radius, bus what she creature is, is not determinable from the magic jar. The special life force receptacle must be within spell range of the magic-user's body as the time of spell casting. Possession takes place only if the victim fails to make she required saving throw. Failure to possess a victim leaves the life force of the magic-user in the magic jar. Possession attempts require 1 round each. If the body of the spell caster is destroyed, the life force in the magic jar is not harmed. If the magic jar is destroyed, the life force is snuffed out. Returning so the real body requires 1 round, and can only be done from a magic jar in spell range of she body. The saving throw versus a magic jar spell is modified by comparing combined intelligence and wisdom scores (intelligence only in non-human or non-humanoid creatures) of the magic-user and victim.",

      "By means of this spell the magic-user summons up a phantom watchdog which only he or she can see. He or she may then command it to perform as guardian of a passage, room, door, or similar space or portal. The phantom watchdog will immediately commence a loud barking if any creature larger than a cat approaches the place it guards. As the Faithful Hound is able to detect invisible, astral, ethereal, out of phase, duo-dimensional, or similarly non-visible creatures, it is an excellent guardian. In addition, if the intruding creature or creatures allow their backs so be exposed to the phantom watchdog, it will deliver a vicious attack as if it were a 10 hit dice monster, striking for 3-18 hit points of damage, and being able to hit opponents of all sorts, even those normally subject only so magical weapons of +3 or greater. The Faithful Hound cannot be attacked, bus is can be dispelled. Note, however, that the spell caster can never be more than 3\" distant from the area that the phantom watchdog is guarding, or she magic is automatically dispelled. The material components of this spell are a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread."

Likewise, ambulation or some other form of motive power if the recipient of the spell is not able to ambulate, counters the effect of telekinesis, provided the velocity has not reached 16\" per round.

As she end of the spell, the caster will \"know\" that the item is ready for she final test. He or she will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the magic-user who magicked it) versus magic, the spell is completed. (Note that she spell caster's saving throw bonuses also apply so the item, up to but not exceeding +3.) A result of 1 an the die (d20) always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished, she magic-user may begin so place the desired dweomer upon the item, and she spell he or she plans to place on or within the item must be cast within 24 hours or she preparatory spell fades, and the item must again be enchanted.\r\nEach spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 4 hours + 4-8 additional hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again, during casting the item must be touched by the magicuser, and during rest periods is must always be within 1' of his or her person. This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon she item, and each successive dweomer must be begun within 24 hours of the last, even if any prior spell failed.\r\nNo magic placed on or into an item is permanent unless a permanency spell is used as a finishing touch, and this always runs a risk of draining a point of constitution from the magic-user casting the spell. Is is also necessary so point out that while is is possible so tell when the basic (enchant an item) spell succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually take, for each must make she same sort of saving throw as she item itself made. Naturally, items that are charged - rods, staves, wands, javelins of lightning, ring of wishes, etc. - can never be made permanent. Scrolls or magic devices can never be used so enchant an item or cast magic upon an abject so prepared.\r\nThe material component(s) for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being magicked and successive magicks to be cast upon is. Far example, a cloak of displacement might require the hides of 1 or more displacer beasts, a sword meant so slay dragons could require the blood and some other pars of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of a ki-rin. These specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are known by your Dungeon Master."

      "A geas spell places a magical command upon she creature (usually human or humanoid) to carry out some service, or refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by the spell caster. The creature must be intelligent, conscious, and under its own volition. While a geas cannot compel a creature so kill itself, or so perform acts which are likely to result in certain death, is can cause almost any other course of action. The spell causes the geased creature to follow the instructions until she geas is completed. Failure to do so will cause the creature to grow sick and die within 1 to 4 weeks. Deviation from or twisting of the instructions causes corresponding loss of strength points until the deviation ceases. A geas can be done away with by a wish spell, but a dispel magic or remove curse will not negate it. Your referee will instruct you as so any additional details of a geas, for its casting and fulfillment are tricky, and an improperly cast geas is null and void immediately (cf. wish)."

The ice so formed lasts for 1 round per level of she caster. The spell can also be used as a thin ray of cold which springs from she caster's hand to a distance of 1\" per level of the magic-user; this ray will inflict 4 hit points of damage per level of she caster upon the creature struck, with a saving throw versus magic applicable, and all damage negated if it is successful (as the ray is so narrow a save indicates it missed), but the path of the ray being plotted so its full distance, as anything else in its path must save (if applicable) or take appropriate damage. Finally, Otiluke's Freezing Sphere can be cast so as to create a small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool so the touch, bus not harmful. This globe can be cast, and is will shatter upon impact, inflicting 4-24 hit points of cold damage upon all creatures within a 10' radius (one half damage if saving throw versus magic is made). Note that if the globe is not thrown or slung within a time period equal so 1 round times the level of the spell caster, is automatically shatters and causes cold damage as stated above. This timed effect can be employed against pursuers, although is can also prove hazardous so she spell caster and/or his or her associates as well. The material components of the spell depend upon in which farm it is to be cast. A thin sheet of crystal about an inch square is needed for she first application of the spell, a white sapphire of not less than 1,000 g.p. value for the second application of the spell, and a 1,000 g.p. diamond is minimum for the third application of the spell.

If the demon, devil, or other powerful being from a nether outer plane is present in some form (and not possessing another creature's body instead), the magic-user can then begin actual spell incantation.\r\nImmediately upon beginning the reading of the document, the being named will be rooted to the spot unless it makes its magic resistance percentage (adjusted for the level of the magic-user) as a saving throw; and even if such a saving throw is made, the monster feels greatly uncomfortable, and if it has not been magically forced to the locale and so held there, it is 90% likely to retreat to its own (or another) plane, as the named being is powerless to attack the magic-user while he or she is reading the spell document. This first part of the document continues for 1 full round, with the discomfort to the named being becoming greater at the end. During the second minute of the incantation, the being named undergoes acute pain and loses 1 hit point per hit die it possesses. At the end of this round of reading, the being is in wracking pain. The third and final round of utterance of the condemnation will cause a loss to the being of 50% of its existing hit points, horrible pain, and at the end consign it to some confined space on its own plane - there to remain in torture for a number of years equal to the level of the magic-user who prepared the document.\r\nObviously, the being so dealt with will be the sworn foe of the magic-user forever afterwards, so the magic-user will be loath to finish the spell but rather use it as a threat to force submission of the being. Each round of reading will cause the being forced to listen to be a cumulative 25% likely to concede even without any other offerings or payment."

      "Area of Effect: Personal\r\nTenser's Transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power, for when the magic-user casts the dweomer, he or she undergoes a startling transformation. The size and strength of the magic-user increase to heroic proportions, so he or she becomes a formidable fighting machine, for the spell causes the caster to become a berserk fighter! The magic-user's hit points double, and all damage he or she sustains comes first from the magical points gained; so if damage does not exceed original hit points, none is actually taken, but if damage beyond the additional amount is sustained, each point counts as 2 (double damage). The armor class of the magic-user is a full 4 factors better than that he or she possessed prior to casting the spell (AC 10 goes to 6, AC 9 to 5, AC 8 to 4, etc.), all attacks are at a level equal to those of a fighter of the same level as the magic-user (i.e., the spell caster uses the combat table normally restricted to fighters), and although he or she can employ a dagger only in attacking, damage inflicted by the weapon is at +2 additional hit points, and 2 such attacks per round are made by the magic-user. However, it is worth noting that this spell must run its full course, and the magic-user will continue attacking until all opponents are slain, he or she is killed, the magic is dispelled, or the Transformation duration expires. The material component for costing this dweomer is a potion of heroism (or superheroism) which the magic-user must consume during the course of uttering the spell."

      "This perilous exercise in dweomercraeft summons up a powerful demon of type IV, V, or VI, depending upon the demon's name being known to the magic-user. Note that this spell is not of sufficient power to bring a demon of greater power, and lesser sorts are not called as they hove no known names. In any event, the spell caster must know the name of the type IV, V, or VI demon he or she is summoning. As the spell name implies, the demon so summoned is most angry and evilly disposed. The spell caster must be within a circle of protection (or a thaumaturgic triangle with protection from evil) and the demon confined within a pentagram (circled pentacle) if he or she is to avoid being slain or carried off by the summoned cacodemon. The summoned demon can be treated with as follows:\r\n1. The magic-user can require the monster to perform a desired course of action by force of threat and pain of a spiritwrack spell (q.v.), allowing freedom whenever the demon performs the full extent of the service, and forcing the demon to pledge word upon it. This is exceedingly dangerous, as a minor error in such a bargain will be seized upon by the monster to reverse the desired outcome or simply to kill and devour the summoner. Furthermore, the demon will bear great enmity for the magic-user forever after such forced obedience, so the spell caster had better be most powerful and capable.\r\n2. By tribute of fresh human blood and the promise of 1 or more human sacrifices, the summoner can bargain with the demon for willing service. Again, the spell caster is well advised to have ample protection and power to defend himself or herself, as the demon might decide the offer is insufficient -or it is easier to enjoy the summoner's slow death - and decide not to accept the bargain as offered. Although the demon will have to abide by a pledge, as his name is known, he will have to hold only to the exact word of the arrangement, not to the spirit of the agreement. On the other hand, only highly evil magic-users are likely to attempt to strike such a bargain, and the summoned cacodemon might be favorably disposed towards such a character, especially if he or she is also chaotic.\r\n3. The summoned demon can be the object of a trap the soul spell (q.v.). In this case, the magic-user will not speak with or bargain for the demon's services, although the cacodemon might be eager to reach an accord with the dweomercraefter before he is forced into imprisonment. The trapping of the demon is risky only if proper precautions have not been taken, for failure to confine the monster usually means only that it is able to escape to its own plane. Once trapped, the demon must remain imprisoned until the possessor of his object of confinement breaks it and frees him, and this requires one service from the now loosed monster, If the individual(s) freeing the demon fails to demand a service when the monster asks what is required of him, the demon is under no constraint not to slay the liberator(s) on the spot, but if a service is required, the creature must first do his best to perform it and then return to the Abyss.\r\nThe duration of service of any demon must be limited unless the demon is willing to serve for an extended period. Any required course of action or service which effectively requires an inordinate period of time to perform, or is impossible to perform, is SOY0 likely to free the demon from his obligations and enable him to be unconstrained in his vengeance upon the spell caster if he or she is not thereafter continually protected, for a demon so freed can remain on the plane it was summoned to for as long as 666 days.\r\nThe demon summoned will be exceptionally strong, i.e. 8 hit points per hit die.\r\nCasting time is 1 hour per type (numeric) of the demon to be summoned, If there is any interruption during this period, the spell fails, If there is an interruption while the cacodemon is summoned, it is 10% probable that it will be able to escape its boundaries and attack the magic-user, this percentage rising cumulatively each round of continued interruption.\r\nEach demon is entitled to a saving throw versus this summoning spell. If a score higher than the level of the magic-user summoning is rolled with 3d6 (2d10 with respect to type VI demons), that particular spell failed to bring the desired demon. When this occurs, it is certain that the named demon is imprisoned or destroyed or the name used was not perfectly correct, so the spell caster will have so call upon another name to bring forth a cacodemon.\r\nThe components of this spell are 5 flaming black candles; a brazier of hot coals upon which must be burned sulphur, bat hairs, lard, soot, mercuric-nitric acid crystals, mandrake root, alcohol, and a piece of parchment with the demon's name inscribed in runes inside a pentacle; and a dish of blood from some mammal (preferably a human, of course) placed inside the area where the cacodemon is to be held."

To prepare this spell, the magic-user' must hold a gem of not less than 5,000 g.p. value in his or her hand and utter all but the final word of the conjuration. He or she then must hove this same gem available to cast the spell. All that is then required is that the magic-user utter the final word while crushing the gem, and the desired item is transported instantly into the spell caster's right or left hand as he or she desires. The item must, of course, have been previously touched during the initial incantation and specifically named, and only that particular item will be summoned by the spell. If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell will not work, but the caster will know who the possessor is and roughly where he, she, or it is located when the summons is cast. Items can be summoned from other planes of existence, but only if such items are not in the possession (not necessarily physical grasp) of another creature. For each level of experience above the 14th, the magic-user is able to summon a desired item from 1 plane further removed from the plane he or she is upon at the time the spell is cast, i.e. 1 plane at 14th level, but 2 at 15th, 3 at 16th, etc. Thus, a magic-user of 16th level could effect the spell even if the item desired was on the second layer of one of the outer planes, but at 14th level the magic-user would be able to summon the item only if it were on one of the Elemental Planes or the Astral or the Ethereal Plane."

Furthermore, the magic-user has a portion of his or her existence on the Astral Plane when the spell is in effect, and he or she is subject to possible notice from creatures thereupon.

      "By means of this spell the magic-user is able to create a duplicate of any creature. The duplicate appears exactly the same as the real. There are differences: the simulacrum will have only 51% to 60% (50% + 1% to 10%) of the hit points of the real creature, there will be personality differences, there will be areas of knowledge which the duplicate does not have, and a detect magic spell will instantly reveal is as o simulacrum, as will a true seeing spell. At all times she simulacrum remains under the absolute command of she magic-user who created is, although no special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in the normal manner. The spell creates the form of the creature, but it is only a zombie-like creature. A reincarnation spell must be used so give the duplicate a vital force, and a limited wish spell must be used so empower the duplicate with 40% to 65% (35% + 5% to 30%) of the knowledge and personality of the original. The level, if any, of the simulacrum, will be from 20% so 50% of the original creature. The duplicate creature is formed from ice or snow. The spell is cast over the rough form, and some piece of the creature so be duplicated must be placed inside the snow or ice. Additionally, the spell requires powdered ruby. The simulacrum has no ability so become more powerful, i.e. it cannot increase its levels or abilities."

      "When a statue dweomer is cast, the magic-user or other creature is apparently turned so solid stone, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried. The initial transformation from flesh to stone requires 1 full round after the spell is cast. Thereafter the Creature can withstand any inspection and appear to be a stone statue, although a faint magic will be detected from the stone if Isis checked for. Despite being in this condition, the petrified individual can see, hear, and smell normally. Feeling is only as acute as that which will actually affect she granite-hard substance of the individual's body, i.e. chipping is equal so a slight wound, but breaking off one of the statue's arms is another matter. The individual under she magic of a statue spell can return to normal state in 1/6 of a segment, and then return to statue state in the same period if he or she so desires, as long as the spell duration is in effect. During the initial transformation from flesh to stone, the creature must make a saving throw of 82% or less, with -1 deducted from the dice roll score for each point of his or her constitution score, so an 18 constitution indicates certain success. Failure indicates system shock and resultant death. The material components of this spell are lime, sand, and a drop of water stirred by an iron bar such as a nail or spike."

The desire to stay in the area or touch/possess the magicked object/item will be overpowering, and unless a saving throw versus magic is made, the creature or character will stay or refuse to release the object.

Thus, changing a lion so an androsphinx would be permanent, but turning a turnip so a purple worm would be a change of only hours duration; turning a tusk into an elephant would be permanent, but turning o twig into a sword would be only a change of several turns duration. All polymorphed objects radiate a strong magic, and if a dispel magic spoil is used upon them, they will return so their natural form. Note that a stone to flesh, or its reverse, will affect objects under this spell. The material components of this spell are mercury, gum arabic, and smoke. N.B.: System shock applies to living creatures, as do the restrictions noted regarding polymorph others and stone to flesh (qq.v.)."

Affected creatures will submit to she demands of any opponent, i.e. surrender, get out, etc.; the hopelessness lasts for 3 to 12 (3d4) turns, and during this period it is 25% probable that affected creatures will take no action during any round, and 25% likely that those taking action will turn back or retire from battle, as applicable.\r\nInsanity - One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 120 will became insane and remain so, acting as if a confusion spell (q.v.) had been placed upon them until a heal, restoration, or wish spell is used to remove she madness.\r\nPain - All creatures ore affected, having wracking pains shooting through their bodies, which causes them to have -2 on dexterity and -4 on attack dice for from 2-20 turns.\r\nSleep - All creatures under 8+1 hit dice will immediately fall into a catatonic slumber and cannot be awakened for 5 to16 (d12 + 4) turns.\r\nStunning - One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 160 will be stunned and reeling for 3-12 (3d4) rounds, dropping anything is or they hold in manipulative members.\r\nThe type of symbol cannot be recognized without is being read and thus activating its effects.

      "This spell is similar to the magic jar, except that the trap the soul spell forces the subject creature's life force (and its material body, if any) into a special prison magicked by the spell caster. The subject of she spell must be seen by the caster, and the magic-user must know the subject's true name as well when the final word is uttered. Preparatory to she actual costing of the trap the soul, she magic-user must prepare the soul prison, a gem of 1,000 g.p. value for every hit die or level of experience she creature whose soul is to be trapped possesses, i.e. it requires a gem of 10,000 g.p. value to trap a 10 hit dice (or 10th level) creature by placing an enchant an item spell upon is and then placing a maze spell into the gem, thereby farming the prison for the soul to be trapped. There are 2 manners in which the soul of the victim can be imprisoned. The final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range, bus this entitles is so exercise its magic resistance (if any) and a saving throw versus magic as well, and if the latter is successful, the gem shatters. The second method of soul trapping is far more insidious, for is tricks she victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word which will automatically place the creature's soul into the trap. If this method is used, it will be necessary to name the triggering item when the prison gem is magicked. A sympathy spell may be placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its soul is automatically transferred so the gem. The gem prison will hold she soul trapped until time indefinite, or until it is broken and the soul is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the creature trapped is a powerful creature from another plane (and this could actually mean a character trapped by some inhabitant of another plane of existence when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), is can be required so perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go totally free once the gem imprisoning it is broken."

Each has a 3\" diameter area of effect, and each sphere will be 2\" apart, along the sides of the pattern, so that there are overlapping areas of effect, and the center will be exposed so all four blasts. The eight small spheres have one-half the diameter (1 ½\") and one-half the damage potential (5-20). They burst in a pattern of a box within a diamond or vice versa, each of the outer sides 2\" long, and the inner sides being 1\" long.

      "The wish spell is a more potent version of a Limited Wish (q.v.). If Isis used so alter reality with respect to hit points sustained by a party, to bring a dead character so life, or to escape from a difficult situation by lifting the spell caster (and his or her party) from one place to another, it will not cause the magic-user any disability. Other forms of wishes, however, will cause the spell caster to be weak (-3 on strength) and require 2 to 8 days of bed rest due to the stresses the wish places upon time, space, and his or her body. Regardless of what is wished for, the exact terminology of the wish spell is likely to be carried through. (This discretionary power of she referee is necessary in order to maintain game balance. As wishing another character dead would be grossly unfair, for example, your DM might well advance the spell caster to a future period where the object is no longer alive, i.e. putting the wishing character out of the campaign.)"
